// JavaScript objects are collections of values wrapped up with named keys.
var userAccount = {
    name: "Kieron",
    id: 0
};
// You can combine these to make larger, more complex data-models.
var pie = {
    type: "Apple"
};
var purchaseOrder = {
    owner: userAccount,
    item: pie
};
// If you use your mouse to hover over some of these words
// (try purchaseOrder above) you can see how TypeScript is
// interpreting your JavaScript into labeled types.
// Values can be accessed via the ".", so to get a username for a purchase order:
console.log(purchaseOrder.item.type);
// If you hover your mouse over each part of the code
// between the ()s, you can see TypeScript offering more
// information about each part. Try re-writing this below:
// Copy this in the next line, character by character:
//
//   purchaseOrder.item.type
// TypeScript provides feedback to the playground
// about what JavaScript objects are available in this
// file and lets you avoid typos and see additional
// information without having to look it up in another place.
// TypeScript also offers these same features to arrays.
// Here's an array with just our purchase order above in it.
var allOrders = [purchaseOrder];
// If you hover on allOrders, you can tell it's an array
// because the hover info ends with []. You can access the
// first order by using square brackets with an index
// (starting from zero).
var firstOrder = allOrders[0];
console.log(firstOrder.item.type);
// An alternative way to get an object is via pop-ing the
// array to remove objects. Doing this removes the object
// from the array, and returns the object. This is called
// mutating the array, because it changes the underlying
// data inside it.
var poppedFirstOrder = allOrders.pop();
// Creates a readonly array of purchase orders
var readonlyOrders = [purchaseOrder];
// Yep! That's a bit more code for sure. There's four
// new things here:
//
//  type PurchaseOrder - Declares a new type to TypeScript.
//
//  typeof - Use the type inference system to set the type
//           based on the const which is passed in next.
//
//  purchaseOrder - Get the variable purchaseOrder and tell
//                  TypeScript this is the shape of all
//                  objects in the orders array.
//
//  readonly - This object does not support mutation, once
//             it is created then the contents of the array
//             will always stay the same.
//
// Now if you try to pop from the readonlyOrders, TypeScript
// will raise an error.
readonlyOrders.pop();
// You can use readonly in all sorts of places, it's a
// little bit of extra syntax here and there, but it
// provides a lot of extra safety.
// You can find out more about readonly:
//  - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html#readonly-properties
//  - https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/types/readonly.html
// And you can carry on learning about JavaScript and
// TypeScript in the example on functions:
// example:functions
//
// Or if you want to know more about immutability:
// example:immutability
